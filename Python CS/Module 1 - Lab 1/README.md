<h1>String Analysis</h1>
<br>
<br>

You are given a string that represents an email address: 

`"My e-mail: eMail_Address321@anymail.com"`.
Your task is to analyze the composition of the characters in the string and determine the percentage of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and other characters such as symbols (#$., etc).
<br>
<br>

To accomplish this, you need to break down the string and calculate the percentage for each category. 
<br>
<br>
The results are as follows:
<br>
<br>
Uppercase letters: 7.5%
<br>
Lowercase letters: 65%
<br>
Digits: 7.5%
<br>
Other characters (symbols): 20%
