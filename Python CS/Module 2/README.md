<h1>Longest Substring</h1>
You are tasked with developing a function that finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string s. 
Consider different scenarios involving various characters in the input string.
<br>
<br>
Scenario: String with No Repeating Characters

Input: `abcdef` <br>
Expected Output: `6` <br>
Explanation: In this scenario, the input string contains no repeating characters, so the entire string itself is the longest substring without repeating characters.

<br>

Scenario: String with Repeating Characters<br>
Input: `abccba` <br>
Expected Output: `3` <br>
Explanation: In this case, the longest substring without repeating characters is "abc" with a length of 3. The characters 'c' and 'b' are repeated, so the substring ends at the first occurrence of the repeated character
